## Current Bugs
- Video does not center when fully responsive i have tried to narrow this down and using media queries has helped. The video 
will be centered when using most devices and on the main desktop however, when testing for responsivness the video will not
always stay centered. I have attempted to fix this problem using position:absolute, but because my other sections are not position 
as relative this does not work. This only places the video central for the desktop size and when narrowing the width covers up the video 
rather than recentering it. 
- When loading the website up using FireFox browser the video does not load correctly. 


#### Bugs that have been fixed
- Time and location tiles images wouldn't center. Fixed by manually resizing images and putting images into CSS instead of HTML.
- Step back on a commit due to messing up css code unsure what the issue was.
- Trying to fade images for location and time using rbga background colour but not working. Fixed using an overlay.
- Times and location images not lining up correctly, one is a little lower than all the rest. Fixed using padding
- Creating a burger menu and keeping text in a list. Fixed using visability as hidden and visible depending on active.
- Video centering - Still having issues, tried using positioning such as absolute.
