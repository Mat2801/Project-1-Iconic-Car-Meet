                <p>My name is Mathew i decided to start this website to give people like myself the oppertunity
                    to attend iconic car meets to view some of there all time favourite cars. Not everyone can
                    afford to own there dream car, but to have a chance of seeing it in person really puts
                    perspective on how beautiful the cars really are. I have'nt seen a website showing you where
                    all Meets take place so i though why not give other just like me the chance to attend there
                    favoutrite car shows. If you have any questions or quiries please feel free to contact us on
                    we would be happy to answer your questions. Sign up and always been in the loop for the
                    next car events and get to meet us in person at the car meets. We would love to meet you all.

                    I own a Toyota Trueno these are a very iconic japanese car with rear wheel drive and a engine
                    in the front, mine has been modified to run a 2jz engine from a Toyota Supra and is boasting
                    an incredible 500bhp. These cars are known for there drifting capabilities however i like to
                    keep mine guaraged and only bring it out on show days. These cars were build from
                    1983 to 1987.

                <p>My name is Wendy ive had a passion for cars since i was a little girl the idea of showing
                    everyone where they
                    can attend car meets was fantastic so i had to get on board, i used to visit iconic car meets
                    with my family and
                    i grew up around older cars. I love the sound they make the artwork invovled and the mechanics
                    behind the car.
                    feel free to sign up and meet me and Mathew face to face at all of these events and come and
                    check out our cars.

                    My car is a Nissan 270z Fairlady in my favourite colour which is white. I bought this car as it
                    was my dream car for
                    many years. its has been very well looked after and only driven on the weekend or when visiting
                    car meets. My car has a Nissan rb26 engine from a Nissans Skyline r34
                    runing around 400bhp just to give it that extra kick.</p>
