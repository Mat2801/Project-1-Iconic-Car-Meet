##Iconic Car Meets
This is a website based on an imagined nationwide car meet where people from all around the nation that own iconic cars, 
can meet up have a chat and show off their cars. This website will be to attract member of the public who are car enthusiasts 
especially those who like iconic cars. There will be stand out images of some of the most iconic cars throughout the website and 
especially on our gallery page where you will also find videos. 
We will have some pictures and videos from our recent car meets and a schedule for when the next meets will take place. 
With a very easy book in system where you can register to take part in our meets and take your place. We will also have a free survey 
where you can take part to be in with a chance to win some free merchandice.

UX
This websites users are intrested in iconic cars and locations of iconic car meets as well as get a little bit of information regarding the
car meets and who runs them.

The site owners goal is to provide a webpage that allows users to read a reliable source of information regard iconic car meets e.g 
(location, time, date)
and information on rules and regulations in place during car meets. 

We are hoping to include features such as
- Event schedule
- Reliable information regarding car meets 
- Images/videos from previous car meets 
- sign up for a newsletter
- sign up to take part in our meets 

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
- link to times and locations by clicking the icon at the top of the page 
- click any location to see the map

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
- w3s
- developer mozilla
- gitpod
- GitHub

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

#bugs
- tried to turn the images into star shapes, managed to create a star shape but not with the image it appeared in the background
reverted to circles 
- time and location tiles images wouldn't center. fixed by manually resizing images and putting images into css instead of html
- text to show over image correctly, darkened the image manually and highlighted text
- step back on a commit due to messing up css code unsure what the issue was.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
