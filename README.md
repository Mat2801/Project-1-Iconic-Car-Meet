# Iconic Car Meets

### Project Portfolio 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials

This is a website based on an imagined nationwide car meet where people from all around the nation that own iconic cars, 
can meet up have a chat and show off their cars. This website will be to attract member of the public who are car enthusiasts 
especially those who like iconic cars. The websites goal is to show users where spesific car meets will take place (iconic car meets) 
all around the country. The website does not sell tickets to the events however, the website can help with showing your cars on stands
and placing them on tracks. There will be stand out images of some of the most iconic cars throughout the website and 
especially on our gallery page. We will have some pictures from our recent car meets and a schedule for when the next meets will take place. 
With a very easy system where you can sign up to take part in our meets. There will also be a contact us section where any users with 
questions can feel free to ask. Also if they would like to have there car on show or on track they can contact us for further information.

# UX
I have chosen to base my project around iconic cars as they are a huge intrest to me and something i can relate to easily. There 
is also a very large gap on the internet regarding car shows and locations, the primary focus of this website is to allow full 
functional interaction with its users to allow for a quick and easy user experience. 
My main goal was to create an easily interactive website to allow users to gain easy accesibility to information they require without
any hassle. I choose to use a simple layout using an attractive landing page image to catch users attention. I opted for a colour scheme
of Black and Orange, the reason for this is i feel darker screens are easier on the eyes and also orange compliments the black to create 
a welcoming feeling. 

This websites users are intrested in iconic cars and locations of iconic car meets as well as get a little bit of information regarding the
car meets. The site owners goal is to provide a webpage that allows users to read a reliable source of information regard 
iconic car meets e.g (location, time, date). 

- Home page, the user lands on this page and can see an image of a huge car show, with a small message which is linked to the location section.
- For users intrested in who organises these car meets they can read short information on the home page or can head to the about us page for 
  more information relating to rules at these car meets.
- If a user is intrested but unsure about anything involving the car meets there is an easily accesible contact us page. They can simply send 
  a question via filing in a short form. 
- Any user intrested in seeing updates and future car meets can sign up to the website by navigating to the sign up page. Again filling out a
  simple form. 
- The gallery page is where the user wants to go to see some of the previous meets and incredble iconic cars. 

### Clickable navigation on the home page
- Text box in landing image where the car icon is shown link to the times and locations.  
- Social media links.

### User Stories

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

# Bugs Throught creating this website
- time and location tiles images wouldn't center. fixed by manually resizing images and putting images into css instead of html.
- text to show over image correctly, used an overlay to highlighted text better.
- step back on a commit due to messing up css code unsure what the issue was.
- trying to fade images for location and time using rbga background colour but not working
- times and location images not lining up correctly, one is a little lower than all the rest.
- creating a burger menu and keeping text in a list. 
- video centering

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?

# Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project as i am a car enthusiast and i attend many car shows. I thought this could be the beginning of a much 
bigger website where all car meets and shows could be placed online for everyone to see and attend also possibly book there tickets or purchase
tickets.
