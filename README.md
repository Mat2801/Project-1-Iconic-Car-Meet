# Iconic Car Meets

### Project Portfolio 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials

This is a website based on an imagined nationwide car meet where people from all around the nation that own iconic cars, 
can meet up have a chat and show off their cars. This website will be to attract member of the public who are car enthusiasts 
especially those who like iconic cars. There will be stand out images of some of the most iconic cars throughout the website and 
especially on our gallery page. We will have some pictures and videos from our recent car meets and a schedule for when the next meets will take place. 
With a very easy book in system where you can register to take part in our meets and take your place.

# UX
I have chosen to base my project around iconic cars as they are a huge intrest to me and something i can relate to easily. There 
is also a very large gap on the internet regarding car shows and locations, the primary focus of this website is to allow full 
functional interaction with its users to allow for a quick and easy user experience. 
My main goal was to create an easily interactive website to allow users to gain easy accesibility to information they require without
any hassle. I choose to use a simple layout using an attractive landing page image to catch users attention. I opted for a colour scheme
of Black and Orange, the reason for this is i feel darker screens are easier on the eyes and also orange compliments the black to create 
a welcoming feeling. 

This websites users are intrested in iconic cars and locations of iconic car meets as well as get a little bit of information regarding the
car meets and who runs them. The site owners goal is to provide a webpage that allows users to read a reliable source of information regard iconic car meets e.g 
(location, time, date) and information on rules and regulations in place during car meets. 

- Home page, the user lands on this page and can see an image of a huge car show, with a small message which is linked to the location section.
- For users intrested in who organises these car meets they can read short information on the home page or can head to the about us page for 
  more information.
- If a user is intrested but unsure about anything involving the car meets there is an easily accesible contact us page. They can simply send 
  a question via filing in a short form. 
- Any user intrested in seeing updates and future car meets can sign up to the website by navigating to the sign up page. Again filling out a
  simple form. 
- The gallery page is where the user wants to go to see some of the previous meets and incredble iconic cars.
- Nearly every part of this website has short navigation via the homepage. 

### Clickable navigation on the home page
- Text box in landing image where the car icon is shown link to the times and locations. 
- Landing image click this to navigate to the gallery. 
- Both owners pictures link to the about us page. 
- Locations and times boxes link to a map of the location.
- Social media links.

### User Stories
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

### Wireframes and Mock write ups can be found here (Link will go here)

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted 
elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

# Testing

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

#bugs
- tried to turn the images into star shapes, managed to create a star shape but not with the image it appeared in the background
reverted to circles 
- time and location tiles images wouldn't center. fixed by manually resizing images and putting images into css instead of html
- text to show over image correctly, darkened the image manually and highlighted text
- step back on a commit due to messing up css code unsure what the issue was.
- trying to fade images for location and time using rbga background colour but not working
- times and location images not lining up correctly, one is a little lower than all the rest.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
