# Iconic Car Meets

![Iconic Car Meets](readme-files/images//logo_smaller.png)

This is a website based on an imagined nationwide car meet, where people from all around the nation that own iconic cars, 
can meet up, have a chat and show off their cars. This websites main goal is to attract members of the public who are car enthusiasts, 
especially those who like iconic cars. The websites goal is to show users where spesific car meets will take place (iconic car meets) 
all around the country. The website does not sell tickets to the events however, the users can book a stand for their car on the website
using the 'Contact us' section of the page. There will be stand out images of some of the most iconic cars throughout the website and 
especially on our gallery page. We will have some pictures from our recent car meets and a schedule for when the next meets will take place. 
Also, within the header there is a 'Sign up' section, users can go here to become a member of Iconic car meets. There will also be a 'Contact us'
 section where users can contact us if they would like to have their car on a stand or on track. Users can also use this sections to ask any 
 further questions they may have.

## UX

#### 1.1. Project Goals
I have chosen to base my project around iconic cars as they are a huge interest to me and something I can relate to easily. There 
is also a very large gap on the internet regarding car shows and locations. The primary focus of this website, is to allow full 
functional interaction with it's users to allow for a quick and easy user experience. 
My main goal was to create a interactive website to allow users to gain easy accessibility to information they require without
any hassle. I choose to use a simple layout using an attractive landing page image, to catch users attention. I opted for a colour scheme
of black and orange, the reason for this is I feel darker screens are easier on the eyes and also orange compliments the black to create 
a welcoming feeling. 

This websites users are interested in iconic cars and locations of iconic car meets. As well as to get a more information regarding the
car meets. The site owners goal is to provide a webpage that allows users to read a reliable source of information in regards to
iconic car meets e.g (location, time, date).
