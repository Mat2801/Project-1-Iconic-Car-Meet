# Iconic Car Meets

![Iconic Car Meets](readme-files/images//logo_smaller.png)

This is a website based on an imagined nationwide car meet, where people from all around the nation that own iconic cars, 
can meet up, have a chat and show off their cars. This websites main goal is to attract members of the public who are car enthusiasts, 
especially those who like iconic cars. The websites goal is to show users where spesific car meets will take place (iconic car meets) 
all around the country. The website does not sell tickets to the events however, the users can book a stand for their car on the website
using the 'Contact us' section of the page. There will be stand out images of some of the most iconic cars throughout the website and 
especially on our gallery page. We will have some pictures from our recent car meets and a schedule for when the next meets will take place. 
Also, within the header there is a 'Sign up' section, users can go here to become a member of Iconic car meets. There will also be a 'Contact us'
 section where users can contact us if they would like to have their car on a stand or on track. Users can also use this sections to ask any 
 further questions they may have.

## UX

#### 1.1. Project Goals
I have chosen to base my project around iconic cars as they are a huge interest to me and something I can relate to easily. There 
is also a very large gap on the internet regarding car shows and locations. The primary focus of this website, is to allow full 
functional interaction with it's users to allow for a quick and easy user experience. 
My main goal was to create a interactive website to allow users to gain easy accessibility to information they require without
any hassle. I choose to use a simple layout using an attractive landing page image, to catch users attention. I opted for a colour scheme
of black and orange, the reason for this is I feel darker screens are easier on the eyes and also orange compliments the black to create 
a welcoming feeling. 

This websites users are interested in iconic cars and locations of iconic car meets. As well as to get a more information regarding the
car meets. The site owners goal is to provide a webpage that allows users to read a reliable source of information in regards to
iconic car meets e.g (location, time, date).

#### Current Bugs
Video does not center when fully responsive i have tried to narrow this down and using media queries has helped. The video 
will be centered when using most devices and on the main desktop however, when testing for responsivness the video will not
always stay centered. I have attempted to fix this problem using position:absolute, but because my other sections are not positionaly fixed 
as relative this does not work. This only places the video central for the desktop size and when narrowing the width covers up the video 
rather than recentering it. 


#### Bugs throughout creating this website
- Time and location tiles images wouldn't center. Fixed by manually resizing images and putting images into CSS instead of HTML.
- Step back on a commit due to messing up css code unsure what the issue was.
- Trying to fade images for location and time using rbga background colour but not working. Fixed using an overlay.
- Times and location images not lining up correctly, one is a little lower than all the rest. Fixed using padding
- Creating a burger menu and keeping text in a list. Fixed using visability as hidden and visible depending on active.
- Video centering - Still having issues, tried using positioning such as absolute.

### 6.2. Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project as I am a car enthusiast and I have attend many car shows. I thought this could be the beginning of a much 
bigger website where all car meets and shows could be placed online for everyone to see and attend also possibly book there tickets or purchase
tickets.
